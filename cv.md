## Briefly about myself:

I'm student and in few years I'll become a engineer-programmer. So first courses at the university can be considered as my start point of my career as a programmer. Subject 'Basics of the algorithmization' introduced me to the main interface of work logic of any programming language. This experience opened up for me wide IT-sphere with interesting jobs.

After research of specialities linked with programming I decided to learn Frontend Development. This decision has 3 reason:
* This IT branch is easier than any other
* Low level of entrance

For me, Frontend Development is interesting and not tiring speciality that inspires me make as much effort as possible to achieve success in this deal.
